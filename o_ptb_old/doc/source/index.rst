Welcome to o_ptb's documentation!
=================================

Introduction
------------

o_ptb is a class based library that runs on top of the well-known Psychtoolbox_. It also uses the VPixx_ system when connected. The latest version also include support for the LabJack U3 device for triggering.

The library tries to achieve two goals:

1. The same code should run and behave as equally as possible whether the Vpixx system is connected or not. If it is not connected, its capabilities will be emulated using the computer's hardware.
2. Make handling visual and auditory stimuli as well as triggers and responses easier and more coherent.
